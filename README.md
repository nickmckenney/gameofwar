# Description
###### "Gameplay. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack."(Wikipedia)
# Challenges to over come
###### It was very hard to over come the process of what classes do differently than functions. Doing this project gave me a better understanding of what classes do differently than functions
# What I still dont understand
###### It is still confusing for me what constructors do as well as supers and this. Its hard to do call back functions inside classes and also when to know when to use "this". Since this project didnt use and child classes I still dont understand what super() does
# What did I achieve in this project
###### A major achievement was learning how to self study or look up things on your own. Learning about classes by myself was very difficult. Very helpfull sources were youtube as well as websites on Object-Oriented programming. 
# What was the purpose of this project
###### This project was intially intended for us to understand functions. Towards the end of the project it was important to understand how to use call back functions inside of classes rather than functions. This was a very important concept to understand since it is part of ES6 rather than ES5. 
# What to Know before starting the project is
* Objects
* Methods
* Classes
* Contructors
* "This" statements
